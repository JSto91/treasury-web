						<h3 style="max-width: 1200px;">Since June 2021, a large group of community members publicly met every two weeks to define and develop the voting system, which is now used in this vote.</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>A group of community developers built the voting system together with the IOTA Foundation</li>
							<li>To participate in the vote, you need your IOTA tokens in the Firefly wallet.</li>
							<li>1000 IOTA Tokens (1 Ki) equals one vote for a milestone that passes during the vote holding period.</li>
							<li>You can participate in this vote [here](link to cast your vote) on the website or directly in your Firefly Wallet.</li>
							<li>A vote is a transaction including tokens sent to the same address where they reside.</li>
							<li>This transaction includes the voting data (ballot ID, opinion that you voted for) and the number of tokens you chose to represent your vote.</li>
							<li>Both standard Firefly and Ledger Nano Firefly users can participate in the vote.</li>
							<li>You can change your vote until xx.xx.21 xx:xx UTC without any consequences - this is called the "commencing period".</li>
							<li>After the commencing period, your vote will start to be counted and gain voting weight for ten days in the "holding period".</li>
							<li>If you want to reach your maximum voting weight, you must hold your tokens in the voting address for this entire ten days.</li>
							<li>Participating in the vote after xx.xx.21 xx:xx UTC is also possible, but you won't be able to gain your total potential voting weight anymore as you have missed some time of the ten required holding days already.</li>
							<li>Voting is feeless. No transaction fees or any other costs are involved.</li>
							<li>Your IOTA tokens are always accessible to you. But if you send them away from the voting address, your vote will stop gaining voting weight.</li>
							<li>The participating community node operators with their Hornet nodes and the IOTA Foundation nodes will count all votes.</li>
							<li>The Hornet nodes will produce the vote results as a file with an immutable hash.</li>
							<li>The community will view and access this voting data on the treasury website <a id="faq-link" href="#faqs"><strong>here</strong></a>.</li>

								Q: Does the whole seed have to vote the same way at any given time? Is it possible to vote for Build with some tokens and Burn with other tokens?
							</button>
							<div class="collapse show" id="question-1">
								<div class="card card-body">
									A: If you wish to do this, we recommend creating two wallets inside your Firefly profile and allocating the IOTAs that should vote for Build in one wallet and the IOTAs that should vote for Burn in the second wallet. After that, initiate the voting process for the first wallet, complete it and then do it again for the second wallet for the other opinion.

								Q: If my tokens are on exchange, can I vote? If not, will I know if exchanges vote with their tokens?
							</button>
							<div class="collapse" id="question-2">
								<div class="card card-body">
									A: If the tokens are on an exchange, you are technically not the owner of the tokens, as you do not have a private key. So you cannot vote with tokens on exchanges. Exchanges will not take part in the vote. All major exchanges state this as part of their policy: they will not use the tokens to participate in any governance activities of projects. Exchange addresses are also well known so that the community can monitor those addresses.

								Q: How does the vote work? Does it keep my vote secret? Or is it a transaction that anyone can see?
							</button>
							<div class="collapse" id="question-3">
								<div class="card card-body">
									A: Yes, your vote is public, like all transactions and messages in the Tangle. The vote is a value transaction with attached data in the indexation payload. As long as no one knows that the address you use belongs to you, the vote is private.

							</button>
							<div class="collapse" id="question-4">
								<div class="card card-body">
									A: Exchanges will not include any voting options on their platforms for this vote. Everyone who wants to participate in the vote will need to withdraw the tokens from exchanges.

							</button>
							<div class="collapse" id="question-5">
								<div class="card card-body">
									A: The community has decided not to introduce any limitations. Limitations would not be adequate: everyone can split large wallets into smaller ones. Therefore it will not be possible to find out which wallets belong together and enforce limitations.

							<div class="collapse" id="question-9">
								<div class="card card-body">
									A: You will always be in control of your tokens. They will never leave your wallet, and you are free to use them for something else at any time. The vote will only be counted until you send your tokens away from the voting address.

							<div class="collapse" id="question-16">
								<div class="card card-body">
									A:
									<h4 class="top-40">If the community votes “Burn”:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>The node operators will initiate a network update that removes the tokens from the ledger forever without any possibility of adding them again. This will reduce the total token supply of IOTA.</li>
									</ul>
									<h4 class="top-40">If the community votes “Build”: </h4>
									<p>
										The community will need to develop a system that can guarantee decentralized governance over the tokens.<br>
										No spending from the treasury wallet can happen until the community has created this system.<br>
										The node operators will only accept and agree to migrate the tokens into the chrysalis network on an address that meets the following requirements:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>There is a system of decentralized governance in place.</li>
										<li>The system is distributed.</li>
										<li>It is owned by the IOTA community and secured and managed using IOTA Smart Contracts (ISC).</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The community can use the Treasury website and voting system to propose the future governance structure and vote on those proposals. 
										A team of community developers will need to build this system for the community.
										The system will need to be tested and fully audited before the tokens can be moved into the control of this system.
										Once the system is built, activating the system will require a final vote by the community.
										If this vote shows that the community is satisfied with the system, node operators will migrate the treasury tokens into an address controlled by the system.
										From this point on, the community can use the system to spend funds from the treasury after successful votes on spending proposals.</p>

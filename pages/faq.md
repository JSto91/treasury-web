## Page 5 FAQ
**TL;DR**
- In this vote, you are asked to decide what should happen to a pool of tokens that have been unclaimed since the initial IOTA token sale in 2015.
- The amount of tokens in this pool is XX Ti - this is  XX.000.000 MIOTA
- These tokens were intentionally excluded from the Chrysalis migration process.
- There are two options to choose from:
- Build: The unclaimed tokens will be used to support and fund projects and initiatives that are important to the IOTA community ecosystem via future votes.
- Burn: The unclaimed tokens will be removed from the IOTA ledger, and the total supply will be reduced by the number of tokens held in the unclaimed treasury pool.
- Since June 2021, a large group of community members has been meeting every two weeks to define and develop the voting system needed to come to the first decision.
- Community developers build the voting system together with the IOTA Foundation
- To participate in the vote, you need to have IOTA tokens in the Firefly wallet.
- 1000 IOTA Tokens equals one vote per milestone passed during the holding period of the vote.
- You can participate in this vote here on the website or directly in your Firefly Wallet.
- You need to confirm the vote using your Stronghold password or Ledger device inside Firefly.
- A vote is a transaction including tokens sent to the same address where they reside.
- This transaction includes the voting data (ballot ID, opinion that you voted for) and the number of tokens you chose to represent your vote.
- You can change your vote until xx.xx.21 xx:xx UTC without any consequences
- After this time, your vote will gain voting weight for ten days.
- If you want to maximize your total voting weight, you are required to hold your tokens in the voting address for the entire ten days.
- Starting a vote after xx.xx.21 xx:xx UTC is possible, but you can only gain a part of your full voting power and will not reach 100%.
- Voting is feeless. No transaction fees or any other costs are involved.
- Your IOTA tokens are always available to you. If you move them away from the voting address, your vote will stop gaining voting weight.
- The community with their Hornet nodes will count all votes.
- The Hornet nodes will produce the count as a file with an immutable hash.
- The community will be able to view and access this voting data on the treasury website here.
**FAQ**
- Q: Does the whole seed have to vote the same way at any given time? Is it possible to vote for Build with some tokens and Burn with other tokens?  
   - A: If you wish to do this, we recommend creating two wallets inside your Firefly profile and allocating the IOTAs that should vote for Build in one wallet and the IOTAs that should vote for Burn in the second wallet. After that, initiate the voting process for the first wallet, complete it and then do it again for the second wallet for the other opinion.
- Q: If my tokens are on exchange, can I vote? If not, will I know if exchanges vote with their tokens?
   - A: If the tokens are on an exchange, you are technically not the owner of the tokens, as you do not have a private key. So you cannot vote with tokens on exchanges.
Exchanges will not take part in the vote. All major exchanges state this as part of their policy:  they will not use the tokens to participate in any governance activities of projects. Exchange addresses are also well known so that the community can monitor those addresses.
- Q: How does the vote work? Does it keep my vote secret? Or is it a transaction that anyone can see?
   - A: Yes, your vote is public, like all transactions and messages in the Tangle. The vote is a value transaction with attached data in the indexation payload. As long as no one knows that the address you use belongs to you, the vote is private.
- Q: Will the exchanges facilitate voting for those whose coins are in these exchanges? Or does everybody have to withdraw their coins to Firefly to vote?
   - A: Exchanges will not include any voting options on their platforms for this vote. Everyone who wants to participate in the vote will need to withdraw the tokens from exchanges.
- Q: Is there some voting weight limit, or can someone with a huge wallet outnumber many smaller ones?
   - A: The community has decided not to introduce any limitations. Limitations would not be adequate: everyone can split large wallets into smaller ones. Therefore it will not be possible to find out which wallets belong together and enforce limitations.
- Q: Is there a plan for a quorum rule?
   - A: The community has decided not to require a minimum quorum.
- Q: What happens if the outcome of the vote is an exact draw?
   - A: If the outcome of the vote is a draw, a second vote will be scheduled.
- Q: Does voting cost me anything?
   - A: No.
- Q: Do I lose control over my tokens in this holding period? What happens if I want to send them somewhere else?
   - A: You will always be in control of your tokens. They will never leave your wallet, and you are free to use them for something else at any time. The vote will only be counted until you send your tokens away from the voting address.
- Q: Who will count the votes, and how will we know the correct result?
   - A: All node operators can count the votes and produce files with the exact counting of their node. Those files can be compared and verified by the community.
- Q: Does the Treasury website have access to my tokens?
   - A: No, never. The website will never access your tokens or your seed or passwords. 
- Q: Can I see how other wallets voted?
   - A: You can see how different addresses voted, but you cannot know which addresses belong together or belong to a person.
- Q: Are my tokens locked for the vote?
   - A: No, you can move your tokens at any time. But you will not continue to vote if you move them.
- Q: How long do you have to keep your tokens locked for each vote?
   - A: To reach your full voting power, you will have to keep your tokens for ten days on the voting address. This is the so-called holding period.
- Q: What if my tokens are still “stuck” on an exchange, and I can’t move them to Firefly?
   - A: In that case, you will not be able to vote
- Q: What will happen after the decision takes place?
   - A:
   - If the community votes “Burn” :
The node operators will initiate a network update that removes the tokens from the ledger forever without any possibility of adding them again. This will reduce the total token supply of IOTA.
   - If the community votes “Build”:
The community will need to develop a system that can guarantee decentralized governance over the tokens.
No spending from the treasury wallet can happen until the community has created this system.
The node operators will only accept and agree to migrate the tokens into the network on an address that meets the following requirements:
   - There is a system of decentralized governance in place.
   - The system is distributed.
   - It is owned by the IOTA community and secured and managed using IOTA Smart Contracts (ISC).
The community can use the Treasury website and voting system to propose the future governance structure and vote on those proposals.
A team of community developers will need to build this system for the community.
The system will need to be tested and fully audited before the tokens can be moved into the control of this system.
Once the system is built, a final vote by the community will be required to agree on activating the system.
If this vote shows that the community is satisfied with the system, node operators will migrate the treasury tokens into an address controlled by the system.
From this point on, the community can use the system to spend funds from the treasury after successful votes on spending proposals.

## Frame 3
### How did we get here?

*Box1*
  - Community crowd sale in 2015
  
    Before the launch of the IOTA network in 2016 with its genesis transaction, the founders of IOTA collected funds in exchange for the option to receive IOTA tokens in an initial crowd sale. 

The crowd sale participants had agreed to collect their purchased tokens in a timeframe of 90 days following the crowd sale. Otherwise, purchasers may permanently lose access to the crowd sale tokens.

  - Network upgrade in 2017
  
    in October 2017, a bug that revealed a part of the usersâ€™ private keys was found in the IOTA code. The IOTA full node operators voted to take into custody any [funds that were at risk](https://blog.iota.org/iota-reclaim-identification-verification-process-e316647e06e6/) The IOTA Foundation then held those funds, and token owners had to prove in a [Know Your Customer process](https://blog.iota.org/claims-and-reclaims-finalization-e692844c505a/) that they have claims on the funds.
     
*Box3*
  - Waiting and reclaim period
  
    The IOTA Foundation started to return the funds to the owners that followed the reclaim process. The Foundation kept the reclaim process for these funds open until 16 June 2021.

  - Chrysalis network upgrade April 2021
  
     As these tokens should no longer be under the control of any single entity, a decision has to be made about their future.  The tokens should be under the control of the community, or they should be destroyed. 

The node operators took this first decision following the Chrysalis network upgrade in April 2021. Node operators had two options:
   - Follow a version of the network where those funds are still under the control of a single actor (IOTA AS Fork)
   - Let the community decide the future use of the funds. (IOTA Chrysalis mainnet).

*Box5*
  - Community treasury vote initiative
  
   In middle of May 2021, a governance channel was established in the IOTA Discord server where the IOTA community could discuss the vote at length.
    Since these early days, many members have been actively involved in developing a solution to give the whole IOTA community a voice and make a vote on the destiny of these tokens possible. 

A large group of community members has been meeting every two weeks to define and develop the voting system needed to make the first decision.
    
*Box6*
 - Community voting
 
    This is where we have arrived today. You are now empowered to take on this crucial decision. You are using a voting system developed by the community, making it possible to collectively decide what should happen to those unclaimed tokens.

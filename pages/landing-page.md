## Frame 3
### How did we get here?

*Box1*
  - Community crowd sale in 2015
    Before the launch of the IOTA network in 2016 with its genesis transaction, the founders of IOTA collected funds in exchange for the option to receive IOTA tokens in an intitial crowd sale. The participants of this crowd sale had agreed to collect their purchased tokens in a timeframe of 90 days following the crowd sale. Otherwise, purchasers may permanently loose access to the crowd sale tokens.
    
*Box2*
  - Network upgrade in 2017
    in October 2017, a bug that revealed a part of the usersâ€™ private keys was found in the IOTA code. The IOTA full node operators voted to take into custody any [funds that were at risk](https://blog.iota.org/iota-reclaim-identification-verification-process-e316647e06e6/) The IOTA Foundation then held those funds, and token owners had to prove in a [Know Your Customer process](https://blog.iota.org/claims-and-reclaims-finalization-e692844c505a/) that they have claims on the funds.
     
*Box3*
  - waiting and reclaim period
    The IOTA Foundation started to return the funds to the owners that followed the reclaim proccess. The reclaim process for these funds was kept open by the Foundation until 16 June 2021.
    
*Box4*
  - Chrysalis network upgrade april 2021
     As these tokens should no longer be under the control of any single entity, a decision has to be made about their future.  The tokens should either be under the control of the community, or they should be destroyed.This first decision was taken by the node operators following the Chrysalis network upgrade in April 2021. Node operators had two options:
   - To follow a version of the network where those funds are still under the control of a single actor (IOTA AS Fork)
   - To let the community decide the future use of the funds. (IOTA Chrysalis mainnet).

*Box5*
  - Community treasury vote initiative
    Shortly after the Chrysalis update, a governance channel was established in the IOTA Discord server as a place where the IOTA community could discuss the vote at length.
    Since these early days in May 2021, many members have been actively involved in developing a solution to give the whole IOTA community a voice and make a vote on the destiniy of these tokens possible. A large group of community members has been meeting every two weeks to define and develop the voting system that is needed to come to the first decision.
    
*Box6*
 - Community voting
    Here we arived today. You are now empowered to take on this important decision. Using a voting system developed by the community which makes it finally possible to decide collectively what should happen to those unclaimed tokens.

# Voting Tutorial

Your vote will happen in the secure environment of the IOTA Firefly Wallet. Either by using your Firefly wallet directly on your device, accessing a profile, and entering the “governance” tab or by initiating the vote from within this website, which will open your Firefly wallet directly on the designated vote functionality.

The number of IOTA tokens you own will give you voting power in this decision.

The procedure to cast a valid vote follows these steps. 
1. Log in to your Firefly profile using your Pin code.
2. Enter the "governance" tab in the sidebar
3. Cast your vote
    - Upon entering the governance tab of the Firefly wallet or using the voting application on iotatreasury.org your first decision is to state your opinion on what should happen to the Treasury Tokens. Choose "cast your vote".

   - Decide for either Build or Burn by clicking the corresponding button. (Find exact definitions of Build and Burn here: link).

4. Now, you are free to choose which of your profile wallets should participate in the vote. That means you are free to decide how many of your IOTA tokens you want to use to participate in this vote. If you plan to use only a part of your tokens, organize the number of tokens in your wallets before voting accordingly. By check-marking your different wallets, the tokens of this wallet are selected for voting. Confirm your selection with the “vote” button.

5. Confirm your decision.
           A field will open that states how your vote will be issued (your opinion and the number of tokens you have
           selected to vote). Check that everything is correct, and then click the “confirm vote”
           Button.

6. Confirm your vote
- Firefly executes the vote as a value transaction that sends your tokens to the same address where they have resided before already. It moves the chosen number of tokens and writes your vote opinion immutable onto the tangle attached to your addresses. You need to unlock your Firefly wallet with your Stronghold password or your Ledger Nano device to initiate this transaction.

7. Once your vote is confirmed, you will see it in the governance tab stating your opinion and how many votes you have cast in this vote.
You will be able to change or cancel your vote from here also.

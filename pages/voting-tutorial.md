# Voting Tutorial

Your vote will happen in the secure environment of the IOTA Firefly Wallet. Either by opening Firefly directly on your device, accessing a profile, and entering the “voting” functionality or by initiating the vote from within this website which will open your Firefly wallet.

Your IOTA tokens will give you voting power in this decision.

The procedure to cast a valid vote follows these steps. 
1. Log in to your Firefly profile using your Pin code.
2. Cast your opinion
    - Upon entering the voting functionality of the Firefly wallet or the voting application on iotatreasury.org your first decision is to state your opinion on what should happen to the Treasury Tokens. Choose either Build or Burn by clicking the corresponding button. (Find exact definitions of Build and Burn here: link). Confirm your selection with the “cast vote” button.

Upon clicking one of the buttons, your Firefly Wallet will open and you need to login to your Profile with the Pin code.

3. Choose the wallets of your profile that should participate in the vote. This means you are free to decide how many of your IOTA tokens you want to use in this vote. Just organize your tokens in your wallets before voting in a way that you are comfortable with. By check-marking your different wallets, the tokens of this wallet are selected for voting. Confirm your selection with the “vote” button.

4. Confirm your decision.
           A field will open that states your vote (your opinion and the number of tokens you have
           selected to vote). Check that everything is correct, and then click the “confirm vote”
           Button.

5. Confirm your vote
- The vote is executed as a value transaction, including your chosen number of tokens which writes your vote opinion onto the tangle. To initiate this transaction, you need to unlock your Firefly wallet with your Stronghold password or your Ledger Nano device.

Your tokens will now be sent to you. After the voting transaction, they will reside on the same addresses as before the vote. The only thing which has changed is that they now carry the information of your decision with them. (Find exact technical details here link)

Once your vote is submitted, it will be handled like a usual transaction and usually confirmed in a few seconds.
You will see a new transaction in your transaction history stating "IOTAVOTE"

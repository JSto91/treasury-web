- The amount of tokens in this pool is XX Ti - this are XX.000.000 MIOTA
- These Tokens were intentionally left out of the migration process.

- There are two options to choose from:
   - Burn: 
   The Tokens will be destroyed.
   - Build:
    The community will start to create a system to govern and use the tokens. Once this is done, the node operators will release the tokens into the control of the new IOTA Community Treasury.
- A large group of community members have been meeting every two weeks since May 2021 to define and develop the voting system.
- The system was built by community developers.
- In order to participate in the vote, you need to have IOTA Tokens in the Firefly Wallet.

- You are able to change your vote until xx.xx.21 xx:xx UTC without any consequences
- After this time, your vote will start to gain voting weight for 7 days.
